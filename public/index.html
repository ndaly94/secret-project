    <h1>My Suicide Thoughts</h1>
    <p>What can I say, Ive been struggling all my life with this, thoughts of suicide that just wont go away. I know I know, theres help out there, well not for me. Ive tried it all. I really have, Ive felt like I tried everything I could 6 months ago but here I am still trying unsuccessfully. Well I give up. I really do. I cant keep trying. 

    I figured out how to make money at one point, I lost weight, I got sober and still nothing. No one wants me, no one wants to be around me. I'm just too far gone and its time for me to go. Ill be much happier when Im dead and I don't have to keep playing this game anymore. Its a useless useless charade pretending that I have any hope of getting better, finding happiness, having someone to love and be loved by. Its just not in the cards for me. And thats ok. But I gotta do what I gotta do. Sometimes you just have to stop.
